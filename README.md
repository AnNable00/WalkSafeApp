Title: Design and development of a pedestrian navigation application for warning about incidents in hazardous areas
 

ABSTRACT

This thesis focuses on the design and development of WalkSafe, an Android app, which, as 
its name indicates, provides users the ability to walk safely, by informing them at any time 
about dangerous incidents that happened near them (e.g., theft, harassment). Users can 
view on a map all the reported incidents that happened in the area or report an incident 
themselves. Moreover, they are able to find a safe route based on the submitted reports, by 
setting the starting point and destination.
The app was developed using the React Native framework for the front â€“ end part, while 
for the back - end, NodeJS, ExpressJS and MySQL were used. Since the app is mainly based
on maps, Google APIs were also used.

3. Install node_modules using npm install command
4. Connect to a physical device (via USB) or an emulator (using AndroidStudio) to run the app
5. Check list of devices using the 'adb devices' command
6. Use 'npx react-native run-android' command to build the app on the selected device
